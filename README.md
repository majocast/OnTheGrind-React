On The Grind is an e-commerce web application where customers can view and purchase our wide variety of coffee beans by the bag. In this application, users can view our products, see the team behind the grind, create/login to an account, and purchase products.
This is all done with the power of the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS).

## THIS WAS ORIGINALLY A GROUP PROJECT
### Note from new site creator: 
My name is Marc Castro, and a year later my love for caffeinated drinks has not changed. With that being said, I revisited this company website to remake and redesign the layout and functionality of our website to highlight just how far we have come as owners and developers. With the power of the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and our supporters, we now have created a website that displays not only our delicious coffee bean selection, but also what we, The Codebusters, wake up to every morning... to a grind!
